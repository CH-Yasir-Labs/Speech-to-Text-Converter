# Speech-to-Text-Converter
This Speech-to-Text File Writer project uses Python, SpeechRecognition, and Google Speech API to convert spoken words into text and save them in a file. The program records audio, recognizes speech, and writes the transcribed text into an output.txt file. It also handles errors gracefully and creates an output folder automatically.
